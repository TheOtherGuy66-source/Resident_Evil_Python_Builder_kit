## To Build

1. You need Python installed.
2. You need to create a folder for RE1, RE2, and RE3.

### Game Versions/ Folder names.

- **RE1** = BIOHAZARD Mediakite
- **RE2** = Biohazard-2-apan-source-next
- **RE3** = Bio Hazard 3 (SOURCENEXT)

### RE1 Modes

RE1 has NVIDIA and AMD modes.

### Mod Names for the Zips

- **RE1**:
  - `Biohazard_mod.zip`
  - `dgVoodoo_AMD_fix.zip`
- **RE2**:
  - `Bio2_mod.zip`
- **RE3**:
  - `Bio3_mod.zip`

### Build Instructions

To build, you need the Team X mods, then overwrite those with the Seamless HD mods. Next, get the Classic Rebirth DLL, update the EXE pack, and include it in the mod zip for each version of the game.

### AMD Fix for RE1

For the AMD fix on RE1, you'll need to find:

- `D3DImm.dll`
- `dgVoodoo.conf`
- `re_ddraw.dll`

These must be the Japanese version of Biohazard for Classic Rebirth to work.
